<h1 id="templates">Templates</h1>

<p>There are two kinds of templates:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Job Templates</strong>: these are connections to the playbooks. You add the credentials, the inventory, variables etc. on which this playbook should run</li>
  <li><strong>Workflow templates</strong>: these are used to orchestrate Job templates, and predefined jobs, such as inventory refresh,  based on success or failure of the previous template</li>
</ol>

<p>While most of this is generic, the provisioning playbooks are platform specific.
The template and workflow creation is  described in detail for each platform</p>
