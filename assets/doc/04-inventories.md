# Inventories
Inventories store information on the hosts we want to run our playbooks against.
Those files can be preloaded from github, staticly or dynamically created

Depending on the demo we use dynamic or static inventories. Please switch to the branch of your platform for more details

You can also define environment and connection specific variables here. Switch to your branch of choice to see what needs to be configured
