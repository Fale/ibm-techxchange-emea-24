## Credentials

For the demo setup, you need a well configured Ansible Automation Platform 2.1+ controller or AWX.
For using the roles you need to provide the SAP software for installation. In this demo we are using the SAP Launchpad roles to download software from SAP Software Center. Hence you have to provide your S-User credentials.

To store and use it safely log into your controller as admin

  1. Create a custom credential type for the S-User
  2. Create the S-User credentials
