# Templates

There are two kinds of templates:

1. Job Templates - these are connections to the playbooks. You add the credentials, the inventory, variables etc. on which this playbook should run
2. Workflow templates - these are used to orchestrate Job templates, and pedefined jobs, such as inventory refresh,  based on success or failure of the previous template
