# Phase 2: Basic OS Setup
#
# This playbook covers the following configuration steps
#  - subscription and repositories
#  - network setup
#  - storage customization

# For our demo, we do not need to install additional packages,
# configure special services, monitoring and backup etc.
# we are good with what the standard image provides

# We need to provide this script the storage configuration
# for each machine. Hence we need to extend the dictionary "server_def"
# with its individual storage configuration for the second disk, e.g.:

#   server_def:
#           - name: server-name
#             [...]
#             storage_pools:
#               - name: volume_name
#                 disks:
#                  - sdb
#                 volumes:
#                   - name: data
#                     size: "128 GiB"
#                     mount_point: "/hana/data"
#                     fs_type: xfs
#                     state: present
#                   - name: log
#                     size: "64 GiB"
#                     mount_point: "/hana/log"
#                     fs_type: xfs
#                     state: present

# Have a look at the documention of the storage role for more configuration options
